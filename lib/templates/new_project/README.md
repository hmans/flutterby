# New Flutterby Site

Welcome to your new Flutterby site! Some notes to get you started:

1. Your site's contents can be found in the `./site/` subdirectory of your project.
2. Refer to the various "underscore" files to see how you can add layouts, helper methods and more.
2. It's very easy to build a new site with Flutterby. Feel free to delete everything from `./site/` and start from scratch!
