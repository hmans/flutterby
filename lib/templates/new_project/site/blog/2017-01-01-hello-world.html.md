title: Welcome to Flutterby!
---


**Congratulations!** You've just created a new Flutterby project through the magic of `flutterby new` -- now it's time to make it your own!

This sample project is set up as a simple blog, but of course you can do so much more with Flutterby. Just head straight into your project's `site` directory and mix things up. Some files you should look at:

| `/_config.toml` | Your site configuration. |
| `/css/styles.css.scss` | Your stylesheet. [Sass]-powered, of course! |
| `/_layout.erb` | Your global site layout. |
| `/posts/_layout.erb` | Your post-specific layout. |
