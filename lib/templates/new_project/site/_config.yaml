# This is your site's configuration file.

site:
  title: My Flutterby Site
  description: >
    This is my new <a href="http://www.flutterby.run">Flutterby</a> Site. I should probably
    change this description in my site's configuration file,
    found at ./site/_config.yaml. Or I can just leave it as is.
    Isn't choice wonderful?
