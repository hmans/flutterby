# Version History

### 0.2.0 (in development)

- NEW: For filters not natively supported by Flutterby, it will now fall back to [Tilt]. This means you can just add any gem supported by Tilt to your project to use it as a template language, with no Flutterby-specific plugin required. Hooray!

### 0.1.0 (2017-01-11)

- First release!
